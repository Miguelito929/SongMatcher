# SongMatcher
Program to quickly match your recording with one of the songs present in the database, uses fourier transforms to create song fingerprints.

You must creat a folder named "songs" in the same folder you want to run SongMatcher.py, this folder must contain .wav files in mono (not stereo).
Then you can run the py file from the terminal or any IDE, enjoy.
